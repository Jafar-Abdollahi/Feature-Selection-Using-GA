<h2> Discription </h2>
genetic algorithm is a technique for optimization problems based on natural selection. In this post, I show how to use genetic algorithms for feature selection.
While there are many well-known feature selections methods in scikit-learn, feature selection goes well beyond what is available there.
Feature selection is a crucial aspect of any machine learning pipeline. However, these days there is a surplus of available data. As a consequence, there is often a surplus of features.
As is often the case with many features, many are redundant. They add noise to your model and make model interpretation problematic.
The problem is determining what features are relevant to the problem. The aim is to have quality features.

Introduction to feature selection
Feature selection methods work to remove redundant features and keep only the ones deemed important in relation to response variable (the variable which we want to predict). By doing so, model complexity is reduced [2]. Feature selection methods do not modify original features, but only select a subset of them.

The feature selection methods can be grouped depending on the methodology used for combining the feature selection with model development into:

- Filter,

- Wrapper and

- Embedded methods [3].

Filter methods are applied before building a predictive model to eliminate features that are deemed irrelevant for the model. One common approach is to calculate the correlation between each feature and the target variable and remove those with the weakest correlation [2]. However, it is important to keep in mind that this method is performed independently of any model [4]. The resulting subset of high-scoring features is then used to develop the predictive model.

Wrapper methods differ from filter methods as they aim to find the optimal subset of features for a specific model by training predictive models with various combinations of features [5]. Unlike filter methods, which remove features prior to model development, wrapper methods ensure that useful features are not accidentally excluded [2]. Overall, wrapper methods allow for a more targeted approach to feature selection that takes into account the specific needs of the model being developed.

Embedded methods perform feature selection during model training, resulting in a final trained model that highlights the most useful features [2]. In embedded methods, the feature selection process is integrated with the model training process, allowing for a more efficient and targeted approach to selecting features.

Here, genetic algorithm will be used to iteratively modify the feature subset by combining parents based on their fitness score, which is determined by the performance of the random forest classifier on the selected subset of features.

Therefore, this approach combining genetic algorithm (GA) and random forest (RF) best fits the characteristics of a wrapper method where the genetic algorithm is integrated with the random forest classifier to optimize the feature subset selection.

2. Introduction to genetic algorithm
Here, genetic algorithm is decomposed into steps for better understanding.

Create an initial population: Generate a random set of N number of chromosomes to create the initial population [6]. If the feature is assigned 0, that feature wonâ€™t be included in training a model on that set of chromosomes. The population in the first picture is made from 4 different chromosomes with randomly distributed genes.
Train a model on every chromosome from the population and define fitness function.
Calculate the accuracy of the model of every chromosome from thepopulation.
